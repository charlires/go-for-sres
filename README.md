# The good of Go for SREs

If you are an SRE Go must be one of the languages you should know for sure.
There are multiple things you can do with it, the industry is already there.

In this repository you will find few reasons why Go is one of the best languages you must master as an SRE

## CLI tools

### Standard Librery

In Go is simple to create you own CLI tool. 

Using the standard library you can create a [simple-cli](./simple-cli/main.go) 

If you want to create a more complex CLI too like [helm](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/cmd/helm/root.go) you can use (Cobra)[https://github.com/spf13/cobra]

### Cobra
Using Cobra you can create complex command line tools [cobra-cli](./cobra-cli/main.go)

Cobra is used in helm, hugo, gh

Why not using bash, it's not intuitive, personally I always struggle reading bash files, there is no intellisense, there is no easy way to test bash scripts.

With Cobra you get this features out of the box
- Help  
- Autocompletion autogenerated
- Do you mean this?
- Flags	
- Multi platform

```sh 
cd cobra-cli
go build .
./cobra-cli echo -t=4 carlos
```

## File Templating

Go has a powerfull templating engine [templates](./templates/main.go)

This template engine has been used by other tools like[helm](./helm/mychart/templates/configmap.yaml)   
HELM takes full advantage of the Go template engine  
<https://www.practical-go-lessons.com/chap-32-templates>  
<https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/named_templates>

```sh
helm template --dry-run ./mychart/
```

## Web server
Go is one of the languages where creating an standalone [web-server](./web-server/main.go) is simple and secure.

## Infrastructure as Code

With Go you can create you own infrastructure using Pulumi 

<https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go>   
<https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec>   
<https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf/api-reference/go>  

### unittest infrastructure as code
You can test you Terraform plans using Go with [Terratest](./terratest/main.tf)
